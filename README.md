<p>Feel free to download and play the game! Or fork a basic bear, and make it super awesome or super strong! The odds of surviving this game is not in your bears favor, so try as much as you can, and remember....its not a valid strength unless its been tested and the test passes! Feel free to use pytest or unittest. In the demo we use pytest on the terminal! </p>
